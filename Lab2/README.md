# LAB 2:NIM GAME 
In the Nim game, players take turns removing objects from distinct piles. In each turn, a player can choose to take any number of objects from a single pile. In the misere version of the Nim game,the player who forces their opponent to take the last remaining object loses instead of winning. Players must employ strategic moves to control the state of the piles and ultimately manipulate the game in their favor. Nim is a game of mathematical strategy and can be played with various pile configurations and rule variations.

**Subtraction Game**

A possible modification is to impose a maximum number of objects that can be removed k for each row.
