# LAB10
## Goal

The goal of this laboratory is to use the Reinforcement Learning paradigm to train a player able to play Tic Tac Toe.

## Collaborations
For this Lab I worked alone,so every suggestion would be very appreciated.

## Adopted Strategy

I implemented both the Q Learning and Montecarlo methods. 
## References

I started from the code provided by the Professor in class and I used his way of representing the board and the states. Furthermore, to understand the problem and have a first idea of the possible implementation I read these articles:
